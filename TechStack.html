        <p id="p">Python</p>
        <p id="ph">Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation.
        Python is dynamically-typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured (particularly procedural), object-oriented and functional programming. It is often described as a "batteries included" language due to its comprehensive standard library.</p>

        <p id="j">Java</p>
        <p id="m">Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is a general-purpose programming language intended to let programmers write once, run anywhere (WORA), meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need to recompile.</p>
